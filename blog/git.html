    <h1>Phase 0 - Week 1 </h1>
    <h2>Command Line, Git, and GitHub</h2>
    <h4>1/24/16</h4>

    <article class ="blog-post">
      <p>This is my first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp and coming into this I'm really excited to start learning code, but I must admit, I'm also really intimidated at the same time. This week we learned about Command Line, Git, and GitHub, and all of those words scared me at first, and I'll be honest, I put off getting started on my work for a few days because I didn't know what I was getting myself into...but it's really not that hard!</p>

      <p>All the programmer lingo is really what intimidated me at first, so I'll clear up a few of those terms really quickly.</p>
      <p>
        <li>Command Line: This isn't as scary as it looks. Okay, it might be scary for a little while, but you'll get the hang of it. You type a command in, and it executes that command (for example: "mkdir newfolder" makes a new directory aka folder) and/or returns back feedback to you.</li>
        <li>Shell: Shell is a macro processor that executes commands. The user inputs commands into the shell and the shell then interprets those commands and executes them. This is what the app "Terminal" is. Another name it goes by is "Bash". Bash is the shell for the GNU operating system.</li>
        <li>Version Control: This is a system that software developers use save their work. To loosely compare it to Microsoft Word, it's like when you use "save as" to save your document, rather than just "save" so that you can save multiple versions of what you're working on without overwriting the file. That way, if anything goes wrong, you still have previous versions, and the original document that you can go back to.</li>
        <li>Git: Git is a version control system. It's some software that you download onto your own computer that allows to to save the code you're working on like a tree, with multiple branches.</li>
        <li>GitHub: GitHub is a website where you can upload, or "push" your code to so that you can collaborate with others and you can all work from the same, updated files. </li>

        <p>Now that these "scary" terms are cleared up, I'll go through and answer these questions</p>
          <p>
        <strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong><br>
        <li>Reduces the risk of error. You can branch off from the master file and save multiple versions of what you're working on, and as you work through the code and make it perfect, you can merge it back into the master. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous version.</li>
        <li>Allows you to collaborate with others. If you didn't have version control, like Git, and a site like GitHub, and you were working with a team, things would be really inefficient. You would have to share files through email or a flashdrive, those files might not be up to date, it's hard to work remotely, etc. With version control and GitHub you can push your work up to GitHub and everyone can work off of the same updated files. Changes have to be approved by other members of the team before they can be merged with the master file. It prevents errors and accidents.</li>
        <li>You can work through bugs and avoid having bugs in your code affect the whole repository.</li>

      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong><br>
          There's a command in git, called "git status" and it updates you on the status of the repo you're working in. It will let you know if the files are tracked, if they're ready to commit, and if they've been commited. As you are working through code you can continuously add and commit what you're working on, and you can then push it to GitHub as well. Every time you do a commit (which is kind of like the "save" button) you have to write a commit message, which is a quick summary of the changes you made. Then you can go back and look at all the commits that were made and what was done in each commit, when it was made, and who made it.

      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong><br>
          With GitHub you can store you code online and others can collaborate with you and make changes or add to your code. It's a massive tool for programmers. It's a social media site, it has a massive online community, and it's also a place to store your code "in the cloud". But mostly, it's for collaborating, sharing, and learning.
