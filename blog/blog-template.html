    <b>How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?</b><br>
    Since our layouts were different we decided to work on our own wireframe and look at the differences between them. My pair used Balsamiq to make his wireframe and I used Cacoo. It was nice to see another way of making one. Then once we made the wireframe, we started to do our own HTML on our own, and we helped each other out on that while screensharing and helped each other type everything out and figure out what symantic elements are.<br><br>

    <b>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?</b><br>
    Yes, it helps you visualize what the site will look like so when you start writing the HTML it will be laid out how you want it. <br><br>

   <b>What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?</b><br>
   Our wireframes were very different, but we just talked about how it was good to keep the menus the same on every page you go on so the user doesn't get confused.<br><br>

  <b>What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?</b><br>
  I hadn't done any of the assignments on HTML yet, but I knew I'd be able to pair any way because I already knew some HTML. So I just googled semantic elements and used w3schools.com to help me and I learned really quickly how to use them.<br>
