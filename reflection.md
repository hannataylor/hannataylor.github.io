**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
- I learned by guess-and-check. I didn't use borders for this one, but I did use padding and margin. Padding adds space between the border and the content, and margin adds space around the element.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
- I learned that it's really annoying and I definitely to work more on it. There is static, relative, fixed, and absolute and I still need to learn more about them to fully understand it.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
- Trying to get my navigation bar to align in the center was the most annoying thing and probably took me the longest. I forget how I ultimately got it ot do it. I think I did text-align: center on the body and then the rest lined up, I think.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
Everything. Before doing this challenege, I honestly didn't know much, but after messing around I learned about how to make the center of my site a different color than the actual background. I had to make each section in my site its own class and then add background color, and adjust the padding and margings to fill the whole section with color.
